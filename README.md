# crcmanager-argos
CodeReady Containers Status Manager plugin for the Argos Gnome Extension.

Depends on the [Argos Gnome Extension](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos)

To install place crcmanager.right.1m.sh in ~/.config/argos or where ever you have configured Argos to look for scripts.


--Roadmap--

With the release of Gnome 40 I'm exploring creating a full extension or Gnome Boxes integration with CodeReady Containers.
